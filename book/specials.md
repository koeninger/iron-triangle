"You" means the character with the special, "allies" means characters on the same side of the conflict as the character with the special.
Unless otherwise specified, a character may use a given instance of a special once per session, and may not use more than one special per round.

Unless otherwise specified, you must choose the type of conflict (mental, physical, social) and type of die (attack, defend, trick) a special applies to when you gain it.
You may gain multiple instances of a given special for different types of conflict or dice, but not for the same type.
E.g. you can have Relentless Physical Attack and Relentless Mental Defend, but not two uses of Relentless Physical Attack.

The GM must declare use of specials before the players.  E.g. if a GM declares Parry, a player may decide not to waste Sadistic.
For player vs player, at each timing when a special could be used, secretly write the special or None on an index card, then simultaneously reveal.
Resolve disagreements regarding timing or interaction between specials in favor of the players.  For player vs player resolve via a separate unmodified roll.

## Parry
After you lose a roll, you ignore the damage.

## Reflect
After you lose a roll, you inflict damage equal to the damage you suffered.

## Double
After you win a roll, you inflict twice the damage (three times the damage on a critical).

## Precise
After you win a roll, you choose where the damage is distributed.

## Sadistic
After you win a roll, you heal equal to the damage you inflict.
Healing may be distributed among different attributes, but only those corresponding to this type of conflict.

## Premonition
Before rolling, prevent your opponent from using the specified type of die.

## Insight
Before rolling, learn the current values of a single opponent's attributes and which specials they have available.
Applies to any type of die, but different types of conflict still require gaining different versions of Insight.

## Martyr
Before rolling, choose an amount of damage to suffer, then heal anyone an equivalent amount.
Applies to any type of die, but different types of conflict still require gaining different versions of Martyr.

## Relentless
Before rolling, choose two of the specified dice.  Roll both, and use the highest result.

## Flexible
Before rolling, choose two different dice.  Roll both, and choose which result you want to apply (doesn't have to be the highest).
Must be gained for each combination of dice, e.g. Flexible Physical Attack & Defend is distinct from Flexible Physical Attack & Trick.

## Bodyguard
After anyone loses a roll, suffer the damage instead of them.
Applies to any type of die, but different types of conflict still require gaining different versions of Bodyguard.

## Resourceful
Before rolling in the first round of a conflict, you may choose to use a different set of attributes for inflicting and suffering damage.
This does not change the type of conflict.
Lasts until the end of the conflict, and you may not change back to the original attributes.
Applies to any type of die, but may only be gained once, for a particular combination of attributes and conflict.
For example, you may have Resourceful Physical for Social conflict (e.g. you're intimidating), or Resourceful Mental for Physical conflict (e.g. you're a wizard), but not both.

## Mimic
Duplicate the effect of a special that has been used by someone other than you in this conflict.
Must be used with the corresponding timing and dice if applicable. 
Cannot duplicate Last Stand.

## Last Stand
Only once in your lifetime, in a conflict where death is at stake, after anyone rolls but before damage is inflicted.
Lasts until the end of the conflict, at which point you die irrevocably.
Until then, you have full health for purposes of inflicting damage and cannot be killed.
May be used even if you have already used a special this round.
Cannot be used by the GM or in player vs player conflicts.
Applies to all types of conflicts and dice, you only need to gain Last Stand once.
