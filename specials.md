"You" means the character with the special, "allies" means characters on the same side of the conflict as the character with the special.
Unless otherwise specified, a character may use a given instance of a special once per session, and may not use more than one special per round.

Unless otherwise specified, you must choose the type of conflict (mental, physical, social) and type of die (attack, defend, trick) a special applies to when you gain it.
You may gain multiple instances of a given special for different types of conflict or dice, but not for the same type.
E.g. you can have Relentless Physical Attack and Relentless Mental Defend, but not two uses of Relentless Physical Attack.

The GM must declare use of specials before the players.  E.g. if a GM declares Parry, a player may decide not to waste Sadist.
For player vs player, at each timing when a special could be used, secretly write the special or None on an index card, then simultaneously reveal.
Resolve disagreements regarding interaction between specials in favor of the players.  For player vs player resolve in favor of the person who won the unmodified original roll leading to the disagreement.

## Parry
After you lose a roll, you ignore the damage.

## Reflect
After you lose a roll, you inflict damage equal to the damage you suffered.

## Relentless
After you lose a roll, reroll the same die once and take the second result, potentially changing the loss to a win.

## Double
After you win a roll, you inflict twice the damage (four times the damage on a critical).

## Precise
After you win a roll, you choose where the damage is distributed.

## Sadist
After you win a roll, you heal equal to the damage you inflict.
Healing may be distributed among different attributes, but only those corresponding to this type of conflict.

## Premonition
Before rolling, prevent your opponent from using the specified type of die.

## Insight
Before rolling, learn the current values of your opponent's attributes and which specials they have available.
Applies to any type of dice, but different types of conflict still require gaining different versions of Insight.

## Martyr
Before rolling, choose an amount of damage to suffer, then heal anyone an equivalent amount.
Applies to any type of dice, but different types of conflict still require gaining different versions of Martyr.

## Versatile
Before rolling, choose two different dice.  Roll both, and choose which result you want to apply (doesn't have to be the highest).
Must be gained for each combination of dice, e.g. Versatile Physical Attack & Defend is distinct from Versatile Physical Attack & Trick.

## Bodyguard
After anyone loses a roll, suffer the damage instead of them.
Applies to any type of dice, but different types of conflict still require gaining different versions of Bodyguard.

## Last Stand
Only once in your lifetime, in a conflict where death is at stake, after anyone rolls but before damage is inflicted.
Lasts until the end of the conflict, at which point you die irrevocably.
Until then, you have full health for purposes of inflicting damage and cannot be killed.
May be used even if you have already used a special this round.
Applies to all types of conflicts and dice, you only need to gain Last Stand once.
